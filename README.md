# KQL-Threat-Hunting-Quick-n-Dirty
This is a collection of simple and effective KQL (Kusto Query Language) queries that I developed as a beginner to quickly hunt for threats. This repository aims to provide easy-to-use queries for any beginner security analysts and/or enthusiasts to detect potential threats in their environments.
<br>
<br>
## Usage
The qeuries are grouped together in their respective folders based on their area i.e. Network, Processes, Registry, Files etc. To use these queries, simply copy and paste them into your KQL editor. Modify the parameters as needed to fit your specific environment.
